# React + Webpack Boilerplate

## Motivation
There are many ways to build React App. One of them is `create-react-app`. It's very popular since FB announce that, and you just run few command and TADA! Your React App is running without you need to config what's happening behind. How about your port, environment, modify or adding some config? How about production environment? What is differences with development environment? It's possible on `create-react-app` if you do `yarn eject` or `npm run eject`. But so much code that you have to read. Whereas you need it fast to start coding for development and production React App.

Here, I try to create minimal boilerplate React App with webpack. Let's check this code out!

Happy React!
